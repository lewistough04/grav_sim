# My Project

**This project** demonstrates how to **simulate gravity** between bodies of mass.

## Features

- Simulates gravitational forces between multiple bodies.
- Visualises simulation in 3D space.

## Installation

1. Clone repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https ://github.com/lewistough04/grav_sim.git
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd grav_sim
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r "requirements.txt"

## Future Plans

These are ideas which I plan on implementing for expanding the functionality of this project:

- **Algortithms** - Adding multiple algorithms for the user to switch between
- **User Interface** - Develop a more friendly user interface that allows users to set initial conditions and start/stop sim without having to edit the code
- **Configurable Simulation Speed** - Allows users to adjust the speed at which time passes dynamically in simulation
- **Configurable Time Step** - Allow users to edit the time step dynamically in the simulation to give increased precision
- **Parallel Computing** - Implement parallel processing to speed up simulation calculations between large numbers of bodies
- **Relavistic Effects** - Add relavistic effects to increase accuracy for high velocities and strong gravitational fields
- **Real-Time Analytics** - Display real-time data e.g. forces, momentum, energy on interface
- **Presets** - Create library of presets e.g. solar systems, star systems and possibly galaxies
- **Data Logging** - Implement data logging that allows users to export simulation data
- **Unit Conversion** - Implement unit conversion software to allow scales to increase e.g. light years and astronomicals units
- **Time Dilation** - Add time dilation option that shows its impact from a selected frame of reference

Some of these are more challenging than others but will be a fun challenge!
